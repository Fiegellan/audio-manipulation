# Audio Processing with Docker

This repository contains a script for processing audio files stored in an S3 bucket. It transcribes the audio and saves the results as a parquet file.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- An S3 bucket containing your audio files.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t audio-processing .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container, mounting the directory where you want to save the generated parquet files:
    ```bash
    docker run -v /path/on/your/machine:/app/data audio-processing
    ```

    **Note**: Replace `/path/on/your/machine` with the directory path on your host where you'd like to save the parquet files. The container will save the parquet files to `/app/data`, which will be mirrored to your specified host directory.

## Environment Configuration

You'll need to set some environment variables to access your S3 bucket. Place them in a `.env` file at the root of this project:

```
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_url
BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

These will be loaded and used in the Python script.

## Under the Hood

### Dockerfile

We use a lightweight Python 3.9 base image. The required packages, such as `ffmpeg` and `libsndfile1`, are installed to support audio processing. The Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and are installed during the image build.

### Python Script

The script does the following:

1. Loads environment variables from `.env`.
2. Connects to the S3 bucket and retrieves a list of audio files.
3. Transcribes each audio file.
4. Processes and tokenizes the audio data.
5. Saves the results to a parquet file.

### Accessing Environment Variables in the Script

We use the `python-decouple` library to manage environment variables. This allows us to easily load and use variables from the `.env` file:

```python
from decouple import config

S3_ACCESS_KEY = config('S3_ACCESS_KEY')
S3_SECRET_KEY = config('S3_SECRET_KEY')
S3_ENDPOINT = config('S3_ENDPOINT')
BUCKET_NAME = config('BUCKET_NAME')
```

### Saving Data

The processed data is saved as a parquet file inside the container at `/app/data`. Thanks to Docker's volume mounting, this data is also saved to the specified directory on your host machine.
